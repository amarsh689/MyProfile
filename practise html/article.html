        <p> <b>1914 translation by H. Rackham </b> <br>

            "But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and
            I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of
            the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself,
            because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter
            consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain
            pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can
            procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical
            exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who
            chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no
            resultant pleasure?"</p>

            According to adherents, the source of the “light” was viewed as being directly communicated from a higher
            source or due to a clarified and exalted condition of the human intelligence. To the former class belong the
            Alumbrados (Spanish: “enlightened”) of Spain. Spanish historian Marcelino Menéndez y Pelayo first finds the
            name about 1492 (in the form aluminados, 1498) but traces them back to a gnostic origin and thinks their
            views were promoted in Spain through influences from Italy. One of their earliest leaders—indeed, some
            scholars style her as a “pre-Alumbrado”—was María de Santo Domingo, who came to be known as La Beata de
            Piedrahita. She was a labourer’s daughter, born in Aldeanueva, south of Salamanca, about 1485. She joined
            the Dominican order as a teenager and soon achieved renown as a prophet and mystic who could converse
            directly with Jesus Christ and the Virgin. Ferdinand of Aragon invited her to his court, and he became
            convinced of the sincerity of her visions. The Dominicans appealed to Pope Julius II for guidance, and a
            series of trials were convened under the auspices of the Inquisition. Her patrons, which by then included
            not only Ferdinand but also Francisco Cardenal Jiménez de Cisneros and the duke of Alba, ensured that no
            decision was taken against her, and she was cleared in 1510.</p>
